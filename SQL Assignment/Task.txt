1.             Oracle project: Overall process

Please go through the following points when you solve the project! Please use these bullets when you prepare your documentation!

    Choose test data
        Minimum 5 tables
        About 0.1-0.2 million records in two tables to have bigger dataset
    Plan your schema objects and create them
        Create a data model (SQL developer data modeler project can be used)
        Create your own schema objects
        Include sequence and trigger objects
    Load the data into the schema objects!

Document all your steps in your word document!
2.             Possible tools to use for test data documentation and generation
2.1.         SQL Developer data modeler

To create a data model you can use this tool
2.2.         Possibilities to load data into oracle

    Simple SQL commands, scripts run by SQL Plus or any other SQL client
    Comma separated values as external table and insert – select statement.
    Export – import from another oracle database
    Export – import data pump
    SQL Loader to load in plain text files
    SQL Developer

Tip: Remove indexes, triggers from the table before data load and recreate them after.

3.             Add to your database

    View 1: Join at least three tables and add in a where clause!
    View 2: Join at least two tables and a subquery and use somewhere a grouping with having!
    View 3: Query using a set operator!
    1 stored PLSQL function which queries one of your view, using parameter(s) and cursor!
    1 stored PLSQL procedure which modifies your database, using parameter(s) and cursor!
    1 complex trigger
    Include at least one insert command and at least one delete or update command with subquery in your PLSQL procedure and trigger!
    Use at least one loop and one if statement in the function, procedure and trigger!
    Grant me (lkpeter) the necessary privileges to use your database objects!
    Demonstrate how your objects work with screenshots!

 
4.            Final output of your homework in a document:

    Write down the process how you generated or created the database objects! ~20%
    How you did you get and loaded the data into them! ~20%
    Data model image and the relational data model, explain them! ~20%
    Explain your database objects (tables, sequences, triggers, function, etc)! ~40%
    You have to include SQLs, shell scripts for schema creation and data load
